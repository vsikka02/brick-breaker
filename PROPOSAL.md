###Project Proposal - Vansh Sikka
For my final project in CS126, I am aiming to create
the game brick-breaker using Cinder. This is an old-school
game that has a platform that is movable and a ball that
is utilized to break/weaken the bricks. This project will
use user-input through the arrow keys or ASDW- keys in
order to move the platform and switch the balls velocity.

I have a little bit of background knowledge on how
to program this application due to previous assignments.
I also completely understand how the game works so that
will make it easier for me to code. Since we are going to
be using a ball with velocities inside a container with
obstacles, this assignment is closely related to Ideal Gas.
The Ideal Gas simulation will be a good basis for my project
which I can extend on top of and make more complex.

Given that we have approximately 3 weeks to complete
this final project, I will decide to split this project
up into 3 different milestones.

1. Week 1:
    1. ASDW Key Strokes Working
    1. Ball Bounce Around In Container
    1. Bounce of Bar.
1. Week 2:
    1. Add Bricks and Obstacles into game.
    
1. Week 3:
    1. Remove Bricks and Obstacles as balls hit them.

The first milestone will simply be getting the ball to bounce around in 
a container and have the platform move around using the keys on your
computer. During the second week, I will make sure that
I have the obstacles a.k.a the bricks set up in my application. The third
week will be used to ensure that I can remove the obstacles as
balls hit the bricks.

In case, I finish the basics of this project early,
I will implement the cool features, where the ball 
splits up into many other balls or making the platform 
longer if the ball hits the desired obstacle. In
addition to this, I may also add levels that have different
designs if I have the extra time.
